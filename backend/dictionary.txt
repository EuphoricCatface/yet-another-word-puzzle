# Dictionary is removed, because the author didn't know what to do with the license problem ;)
# You can put any list of words with newline as seperator.
# Any line to start with # will be ignored.
#
# The game assumes the words are in uppercase by default.
# To use lowercase dictionary, go to `dictionary.txt` and change line three, `DICTIONARY_IS_UPPERCASE = True`.

# https://github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs/blob/master/game/words/en_us - 5,000 words

# http://www.nongnu.org/eliot/en/index.html - 270163 words (compiled using their own `compdic` utility)
# The game will omit words shorter than 3 letters, so its terminal output will probably say a bit smaller number than total word count.
